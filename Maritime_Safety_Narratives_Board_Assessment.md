## Narrative 1: The Hire-Train-Deploy Model — Reimagining Workforce Development through CTR

### A New Academic Model for Industry-Aligned Education

In 2025, CSU established a strategic partnership with CTR, a maritime and manufacturing staffing company, that represents a fundamental shift in how universities engage with workforce development. Unlike traditional academic models where students complete education before entering the workforce, the Hire-Train-Deploy model inverts this sequence—workers are hired first, trained through CSU's curriculum while employed, and deployed into advancing roles within their organizations.

This partnership positions CSU as the exclusive online learning provider for shipbuilding workforce pipelines across the nation's most critical maritime manufacturing corridor. The model addresses a persistent industry challenge: workers historically faced an impossible choice between earning and learning. Our approach eliminates that barrier.

### The "Labor-to-Leader" Progression

At the heart of this partnership is what we call the "labor-to-leader" progression—a clearly defined pathway that enables shipyard workers to advance from the shop floor to supervisory roles and ultimately to degree completion, all while maintaining employment. This isn't supplemental education; it's career architecture built into the employment relationship itself.

The CTR welding training initiative exemplifies this approach. Rather than recruiting students who hope to find welding jobs after graduation, we work with CTR to identify hired welders who need advancement-ready credentials. The curriculum meets them where they are—employed—and builds their capabilities systematically toward leadership positions.

### Strategic Market Position

Joint CTR/CSU visits to major shipbuilders Austal and Ingalls in January 2026 advanced this partnership into active implementation discussions. Coordinated meetings with Virginia shipbuilders—NASCO, BAE, and Newport News Shipbuilding—reinforced the urgency: Newport News alone maintains 250+ open positions in a region where 95% of the local economy depends on shipbuilding. The signing of a Learning Partnership with Newport News Shipbuilding demonstrates industry confidence in this model.

**What makes this partnership transformational:** CSU is not simply offering courses to an industry. We are embedding ourselves into the workforce pipeline as an essential infrastructure component—as necessary to shipbuilding operations as steel suppliers and dry docks.

## Narrative 2: Custom Curriculum through Continuing Education — Responsive Academic Design for Industry Partners

### Beyond Traditional Course Catalogs

CSU's Continuing Education approach in 2025 established a new paradigm: curriculum designed in direct response to industry partner needs rather than adapted from existing academic offerings. This represents a fundamental shift from "here's what we teach" to "what do you need your workforce to know?"

### LiveView Technologies Academic Partnership

The Academic Partnership with LiveView Technologies exemplifies this model. Born from our existing relationship with AXON, this partnership develops technology coursework specifically designed for the Physical Security industry—a sector that previously relied on fragmented vendor training and informal knowledge transfer.

The curriculum addresses a dual market opportunity: corporate retail security operations and law enforcement technology integration. Rather than offering generic technology courses that security professionals might find useful, we collaborated with LiveView to identify the precise competencies their industry requires and built curriculum to those specifications.

### 2025-2026 Custom Curriculum Initiatives

The LiveView partnership established a replicable framework now extending across multiple industry sectors:

**Insurance Industry Curriculum** — Developed under the College of Business, this initiative creates specialized pathways for insurance agents and staff (functioning as a "Producer School"), claims adjusters, emergency management and disaster resilience professionals, and fortified construction specialists. The "Financial First Responders" concept emerged from this work, recognizing that insurance professionals serve as essential community infrastructure during crisis events.

**Signal Mutual Maritime Curriculum** — The 2025 launch of maritime curriculum included a webinar rollout to 243 members of Signal Mutual, demonstrating the scale of industry demand. This partnership continues developing content that directly addresses shipbuilding workforce requirements.

**NCCER Curriculum Alignment** — November 2025 meetings with NCCER's CEO and Chief Learning Officer mapped curriculum alignment across 70 subject areas in six major trade clusters. A significant discovery emerged: safety programs connect to nearly all NCCER trades, creating a universal entry point for workforce engagement. This MOU is expected to formalize in early 2026, with potential introductions to major contractors Bechtel and Kiewit.

**Philippine Nurses Association of America Partnership** — Through the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, this agreement extends custom curriculum development into healthcare workforce pipelines serving international nursing professionals.

**What makes this approach distinctive:** CSU functions as a curriculum development partner, not merely a course provider. Industry partners gain educational programs that reflect their actual operational requirements, while CSU gains market differentiation that competitors cannot easily replicate.

## Narrative 3: Pathways from Skilled Trades — Opening Educational Access through Maritime Safety Work

### From Safety Training to Degree Completion

CSU's maritime safety initiatives revealed an unexpected opportunity: skilled trades workers engaged through safety training represent an underserved population hungry for educational advancement. The maritime safety work became a gateway—not to credential collection, but to comprehensive educational pathways that recognize and build upon existing professional competencies.

### The Discovery

Through our Signal Mutual partnership and CTR collaboration, we observed a consistent pattern: workers who engaged with maritime safety curriculum expressed interest in broader educational opportunities. These weren't traditional students seeking career entry; they were experienced professionals who had been told—explicitly or implicitly—that higher education wasn't designed for people like them.

The NCCER curriculum alignment work reinforced this insight. When we mapped 70 subject areas across six trade clusters, we found that safety programs connected to virtually every trade discipline. Safety training isn't peripheral to skilled trades—it's the common thread. This creates a natural entry point: workers who complete safety certifications have already demonstrated commitment to professional development and capacity for structured learning.

### Building the Pathways

CSU's response to this discovery involves three interconnected strategies:

**Recognition of Prior Learning** — Maritime safety work positioned CSU to develop competency-based recognition frameworks. Workers don't start from zero; their professional experience and existing certifications translate into academic credit, shortening the path to degree completion.

**Flexible Delivery Models** — The $250/credit hour advantage positions CSU competitively, but the real value lies in delivery format. Online, asynchronous coursework accommodates shift workers, travel requirements, and family obligations that make traditional campus attendance impossible for most skilled trades professionals.

**Stackable Credentials** — Rather than requiring commitment to a four-year degree program, pathways are designed as stackable credentials. A worker might begin with safety certifications, add supervisory training, complete an associate degree, and eventually finish a bachelor's—each step valuable independently, each step building toward the next.

### The Benefit Company Channel

The in-person business reviews with PerkSpot, EBG/TicketsatWork, and BenefitHub revealed how CSU reaches skilled trades workers at scale. These benefit platforms serve as distribution channels to employer populations—including discussions regarding Walmart and Amazon employee audiences—where traditional university marketing cannot penetrate.

A critical insight emerged from these reviews: CSU's $250/credit hour pricing was being obscured by percentage-discount messaging. Telling a skilled trades worker they receive a 15% discount is far less compelling than explaining that competitors charge $700 per credit hour. Messaging realignment in 2026 will emphasize absolute cost advantage to populations acutely sensitive to educational debt concerns.

### Broader Implications

The NextOp Learning Partnership extends this pathway model to military veterans—another population with substantial professional competencies that traditional higher education often fails to recognize. The "labor-to-leader" concept developed through CTR applies equally: these are not students becoming workers, but workers becoming credentialed leaders without abandoning the employment that supports their families.

**What makes this transformational:** CSU identified that maritime safety training—a seemingly narrow compliance function—actually opens access to educational advancement for an entire population segment previously excluded from higher education. Safety certification becomes the first step in a journey toward degree completion, with each step designed to accommodate the realities of working adult lives.

## Summary: The Partnership Narrative for Board Assessment

These three narratives share a common thread: CSU is redefining the relationship between higher education and workforce development.

1. **Hire-Train-Deploy** inverts the traditional sequence, embedding education within employment rather than before it.

2. **Custom Curriculum** positions CSU as an academic development partner rather than a course catalog, creating industry-specific programs that competitors cannot easily replicate.

3. **Pathways from Skilled Trades** recognizes that compliance training—specifically maritime safety—functions as a gateway to comprehensive educational access for underserved working adult populations.

Together, these initiatives demonstrate that CSU's partnership strategy isn't about signing agreements—it's about fundamentally reimagining how a university serves workforce needs. The maritime safety sector provided the proving ground; the model now extends across manufacturing, healthcare, insurance, physical security, and space operations.

The partnerships signed in 2025—CTR, LiveView Technologies, Newport News Shipbuilding, NextOp, Signal Mutual, NCCER (pending), and others—represent not just revenue opportunities but structural positioning that will define CSU's competitive advantage for years to come.
