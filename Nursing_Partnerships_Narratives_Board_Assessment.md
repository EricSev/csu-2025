## Narrative 1: Regional Healthcare Workforce Development — Infirmary Health as the Flagship Model

### Building Educational Infrastructure Within South Alabama's Largest Healthcare System

In 2025, CSU formalized a strategic partnership with Infirmary Health System, the largest hospital network in South Alabama, that establishes a replicable model for healthcare workforce development. This partnership represents more than traditional employer engagement—it embeds CSU directly into the professional advancement infrastructure of a major regional healthcare provider.

Following presentations by Dr. Bonny Kehm and Jim Forsythe in July 2025, Infirmary Health took the significant step of designating a Learning and Development liaison specifically to coordinate CSU partnership activities. This institutional commitment—dedicating internal resources to manage the relationship—signals that Infirmary views CSU not as one vendor among many, but as a strategic educational partner essential to workforce development.

### The Activation Model

The Infirmary Health partnership demonstrates CSU's approach to healthcare engagement: systematic, facility-by-facility activation that builds visibility across thousands of healthcare professionals. On-site information sessions across multiple Infirmary locations connect CSU's nursing and allied health programs directly to employees seeking professional advancement.

This activation model addresses a fundamental challenge in healthcare education: reaching working professionals where they are. Nurses working 12-hour shifts cannot easily attend campus recruiting events or career fairs. By bringing CSU to Infirmary facilities during working hours, the partnership eliminates barriers between healthcare professionals and educational advancement.

### Strategic Positioning

The August 2025 promotion of nursing programs at the Infirmary Health-North Chamber showcase extended partnership visibility beyond facility walls into the broader business community. The scheduled January 2026 lunch meeting with VP of HR Angela Rosler will advance discussions on deeper integration between CSU programs and Infirmary's internal career development pathways.

**What makes this partnership transformational:** Infirmary Health serves as a proof-of-concept that CSU can become the preferred educational partner for regional healthcare systems. The model—dedicated liaison, systematic facility activation, leadership engagement—is designed to scale across other healthcare networks in Alabama and beyond.

## Narrative 2: International Nursing Workforce Pipelines — Philippine Nurses Association of America Partnership

### Extending CSU's Reach to Global Healthcare Professionals

The 2025 Partnering Agreement with the Philippine Nurses Association of America (PNAA) positions CSU to serve an underserved but strategically critical population: international nursing professionals seeking U.S.-recognized credentials while maintaining employment. This partnership extends custom curriculum development into healthcare workforce pipelines serving Filipino-American nurses and nursing professionals worldwide.

### The Strategic Opportunity

Filipino nurses represent one of the largest international nursing populations in the United States, yet educational pathways serving this community have historically been fragmented or non-existent. The PNAA partnership creates a direct channel to this population through an established professional association with national reach and community credibility.

Dr. Bonny Kehm's leadership in cultivating this relationship—including support for the Filipino-American Empowering Dreams Scholarship Program with CSU's Eagle Level ($1,000) sponsorship—demonstrates CSU's commitment to meaningful engagement rather than transactional marketing. The scholarship support positioned CSU as a visible and valued supporter of Filipino-American nursing education, strengthening relationships with PNAA leadership at both local and national levels.

### Extending the Pipeline: WorldWide Health Resource Solutions

The PNAA partnership laid groundwork for expanded international engagement. Discussions with WorldWide Health Resource Solutions (WWRS), led by Dr. Bonny Kehm with WWRS leadership including Patti Artley (CNO), Laura Dunlap Messineo (CNO), and Ron Hoppe (CEO), explore partnership opportunities with a global leader in virtual and contract-based nursing.

WWRS maintains a large virtual workforce in the Philippines—nurses providing telehealth and administrative support services to U.S. healthcare organizations. This population represents an ideal fit for CSU's fully online programs: RN to BSN, RN to MSN, MSN, and Health Sciences programs that meet U.S. standards while providing international credibility. A potential MOU could establish WWRS as CSU's flagship international healthcare partner.

**What makes this approach distinctive:** CSU recognized that serving international nursing professionals requires more than simply offering online courses. It requires cultural engagement, community partnership, and curriculum that addresses the specific credential recognition challenges faced by nurses educated outside the United States.

## Narrative 3: Healthcare Sector Engagement — Building a Regional Network of Learning Partners

### Beyond Single Partnerships: A Healthcare Ecosystem Strategy

CSU's 2025 healthcare engagement extended far beyond flagship partnerships to build a comprehensive network of healthcare learning partners across Alabama and Northwest Florida. This ecosystem approach recognizes that healthcare workforce development requires presence across multiple facility types, specializations, and geographic markets.

### The Engagement Portfolio

**AltaPointe Health Systems** — Jim Forsythe's multi-day visits to five AltaPointe facilities generated 60 new leads. Despite the absence of employer tuition reimbursement, leadership became strong advocates for CSU programs. AltaPointe's focus on behavioral and mental health aligns with CSU's programs in counseling, psychology, and social work—creating a natural channel for engagement with professionals motivated by career advancement in high-demand specializations.

**Baptist Health Pensacola** — CSU secured invitation to host information tables at Baptist Hospital facilities, marking renewed campus presence after a gap since 2024. Baptist Health's selective vendor policy makes CSU's inclusion significant—it reflects growing credibility in the region's healthcare education ecosystem. Expanded access across multiple Baptist Health sites strengthens CSU's footprint in Northwest Florida's healthcare community.

**Franklin Primary Health Centers** — New contact Charlie White, CEO of this six-county Alabama healthcare network, expressed interest following their recent ACGME accreditation for a family medicine residency program. This represents entry into primary care workforce development, complementing CSU's hospital-system partnerships.

**Community Health NW Florida and Studer Family Children's Hospital** — The November 2025 State of Healthcare event in Pensacola connected CSU with leadership from these organizations, expanding visibility within specialized healthcare segments.

### Professional Association Engagement

The Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses (AMSN) 2025 Conference exemplifies CSU's strategy of engaging healthcare professionals through their professional communities. Dr. Bonny Kehm and Tony Atchley represented CSU at the conference, presenting the CSU-sponsored DAISY Award to the year's recipient—who is also a PNAA member, reinforcing the interconnection between CSU's healthcare partnerships.

Two major opportunities emerged from this engagement: a large 30,000+ member hospital group in St. Louis and the 13,000-member AMSN Association itself. More than 50 CNHS leads were generated, with plans underway to continue AMSN sponsorship and expand collaboration through association-level partnership.

**What makes this approach valuable:** Healthcare workforce development cannot be achieved through isolated partnerships. CSU is building an interconnected network where success with one partner—Infirmary Health's liaison model, PNAA's community engagement approach—informs and accelerates engagement with others.

## Summary: The Healthcare Partnership Narrative for Board Assessment

These three narratives demonstrate CSU's strategic approach to healthcare workforce development:

1. **Regional Flagship Partnerships** (Infirmary Health) establish CSU as the preferred educational partner for major healthcare systems through dedicated liaison relationships, systematic facility activation, and leadership engagement at the executive level.

2. **International Workforce Pipelines** (PNAA/WWRS) extend CSU's reach to underserved populations of international nursing professionals through culturally appropriate engagement, community partnership, and credential-focused curriculum.

3. **Healthcare Ecosystem Building** creates a comprehensive network of learning partners across facilities, specializations, and geographic markets—ensuring CSU's healthcare programs reach professionals wherever they work.

Together, these initiatives position CSU's College of Nursing and Health Sciences as a strategic partner in addressing healthcare workforce shortages that affect communities across Alabama, the Gulf Coast region, and internationally. The partnerships established in 2025—Infirmary Health, PNAA, WWRS (pending), AltaPointe, Baptist Health, and others—represent infrastructure that will support CNHS enrollment growth and program development for years to come.

The healthcare partnership strategy complements CSU's parallel success in maritime safety and skilled trades workforce development. Across sectors, CSU has demonstrated the ability to identify underserved professional populations, build partnerships that address their specific advancement needs, and deliver educational programs at scale through online delivery models that accommodate working adult lives.
